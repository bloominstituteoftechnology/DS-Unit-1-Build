    What do bike shares do for our cities? 
    We all know that they manifest as public, often sprawling installations of docking 
stations, buzzing with  helmeted urbanites launching into the streets on their way to.. where, excactly? 
    Although I have a bike or two of my own, have driven an electric minivan full of elementary school kids on an infite loop of pickup drop-off, pickup again for the last few years, and avail myself many modes of transportation, I just don't align with the bikeshare model. but I've often wondered while dodging or swerving, *'whither goest thou, boosted biker? And whence returnst thou in the eve?'
    
The answers to these musings were the lofty goals at the outset of my investigation of the [Bay Wheels data set](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels/system-data)
